# Good-Night
Project for CS125

Hey guys, this is where we can keep each of our files as we build our app

Run the following commands:
1. cd app
2. npx expo start

In order to see the mobile app you need to download the Expo Go app and scan the QR code given when running the 'npx expo start' command.

For some reason 'npx expo start' broke and I fixed it using 'npm i expo-cli' and ran it with 'npm start'
